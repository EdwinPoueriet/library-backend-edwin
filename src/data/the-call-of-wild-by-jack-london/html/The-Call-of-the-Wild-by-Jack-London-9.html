<P class="p0 ft0">finally he was deposited in an express car.</P>
<P class="p1 ft1">For two days and nights this express car was dragged along at the tail of shrieking locomotives; and for two days and nights Buck neither ate nor drank. In his anger he had met the first advances of the express messengers with growls, and they had retaliated by teasing him. When he flung himself against the bars, quivering and frothing, they laughed at him and taunted him. They growled and barked like detestable dogs, mewed, and flapped their arms and crowed. It was all very silly, he knew; but therefore the more outrage to his dignity, and his anger waxed and waxed. He did not mind the hunger so much, but the lack of water caused him severe suffering and fanned his wrath to <NOBR>fever-pitch.</NOBR> For that matter, <NOBR>high-strung</NOBR> and finely sensitive, the ill treatment had flung him</P>
<P class="p2 ft2">into a fever, which was fed by the inflammation of his parched and swollen throat and tongue.</P>
<P class="p3 ft3">He was glad for one thing: the rope was off his neck. That had given them an unfair advantage; but now that it was off, he would show them. They would never get another rope around his neck. Upon that he was resolved. For two days and nights he neither ate nor drank, and during those two days and nights of torment, he accumulated a fund of wrath that boded ill for whoever first fell</P>
<P class="p4 ft4">foul of him. His eyes turned <NOBR>blood-shot,</NOBR> and he was metamorphosed into a raging fiend. So changed was he that the Judge himself</P>
<P class="p5 ft2">would not have recognized him; and the express messengers breathed with relief when they bundled him off the train at Seattle.</P>
