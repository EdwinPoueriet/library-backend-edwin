<P class="p0 ft0">His father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge's inseparable companion, and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father. He was not so <NOBR>large,--he</NOBR> weighed only one hundred and forty <NOBR>pounds,--for</NOBR> his mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion. During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of a sated aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation. But he had saved himself by not becoming</P>
<P class="p1 ft1">a mere pampered <NOBR>house-dog.</NOBR> Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, as to the <NOBR>cold-tubbing</NOBR> races, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.</P>
<P class="p2 ft2">And this was the manner of dog Buck was in the fall of 1897, when the Klondike strike dragged men from all the world into the frozen North. But Buck did not read the newspapers, and he did not know that Manuel, one of the gardener's helpers, was an undesirable acquaintance. Manuel had one besetting sin. He loved to play Chinese lottery. Also, in his gambling, he had one besetting <NOBR>weakness--faith</NOBR> in a system; and this made his damnation certain. For to play a system requires money, while the wages of a gardener's helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and numerous progeny.</P>
