<P class="p0 ft0">her to swallow smilingly the bitter pill of rebuff. But this boy was to experience his first dose <NOBR>to-day.</NOBR> She felt again that sensation of almost physical <NOBR>nausea--that</NOBR> sickness of heart and spirit which had come over her when she had met her first sneer and intolerant shrug. It had been her maiden trip on the road for</P>
<P class="p1 ft1">the T.A. Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company. She was secretary of that company now, and moving spirit in its policy. But the wound</P>

He glanced down complacently at the <NOBR>vivid-hued</NOBR> silken scarf that the season's mode demanded. Immediately he was off again. "And the first thing you know, Mrs. McChesney, ma'am, we'll have a motor truck backing up at the door once a month and six strong men carrying my salary to the freight elevator in sacks."</P>
