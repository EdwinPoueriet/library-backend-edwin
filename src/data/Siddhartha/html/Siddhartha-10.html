<P class="p0 ft0">up, paced to and fro, and left the house. Through the small window of</P>
<P class="p1 ft1">the chamber he looked back inside, and there he saw Siddhartha standing, his arms folded, not moving from his spot. Pale shimmered his bright robe. With anxiety in his heart, the father returned to his bed.</P>
<P class="p2 ft2">After another hour, since no sleep had come over his eyes, the Brahman stood up again, paced to and fro, walked out of the house and saw that the moon had risen. Through the window of the chamber he looked back inside; there stood Siddhartha, not moving from his spot, his arms folded, moonlight reflecting from his bare shins. With worry in his heart, the father went back to bed.</P>
<P class="p3 ft3">And he came back after an hour, he came back after two hours, looked through the small window, saw Siddhartha standing, in the moon light, by the light of the stars, in the darkness. And he came back hour after hour, silently, he looked into the chamber, saw him standing in the same place, filled his heart with anger, filled his heart with unrest, filled</P>
<P class="p4 ft0">his heart with anguish, filled it with sadness.</P>
<P class="p5 ft1">And in the night's last hour, before the day began, he returned, stepped into the room, saw the young man standing there, who seemed tall and like a stranger to him.</P>
<P class="p6 ft0">"Siddhartha," he spoke, "what are you waiting for?"</P>
