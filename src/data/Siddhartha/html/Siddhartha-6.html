<P class="p0 ft0">into word and deed? Siddhartha knew many venerable Brahmans, chiefly his father, the pure one, the scholar, the most venerable one. His father was to be admired, quiet and noble were his manners, pure his life, wise his words, delicate and noble thoughts lived behind its brow <NOBR>--but</NOBR> even he, who knew so much, did he live in blissfulness, did he have peace, was he not also just a searching man, a thirsty man? Did he not, again and again, have to drink from holy sources, as a thirsty man, from the offerings, from the books, from the disputes of the Brahmans? Why did he, the irreproachable one, have to wash off sins every day, strive for a cleansing every day, over and over every day? Was not Atman in him, did not the pristine source spring from his heart? It had</P>
<P class="p1 ft1">to be found, the pristine source in one's own self, it had to be possessed! Everything else was searching, was a detour, was getting lost.</P>
<P class="p2 ft2">Thus were Siddhartha's thoughts, this was his thirst, this was his suffering.</P>
<P class="p3 ft3">Often he spoke to himself from a <NOBR>Chandogya-Upanishad</NOBR> the words: "Truly, the name of the Brahman is <NOBR>satyam--verily,</NOBR> he who knows such a thing, will enter the heavenly world every day." Often, it seemed near, the heavenly world, but never he had reached it completely, never he had quenched the ultimate thirst. And among all the wise and wisest men, he knew and whose instructions he had received, among all of them there was no one, who had reached it completely, the heavenly world, who had quenched it completely, the eternal thirst.</P>
